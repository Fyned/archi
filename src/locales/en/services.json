          "question": "Do I need a building permit for a pergola in Belgium?",
          "answer": "Generally, a pergola smaller than 40m² does not require a permit in Belgium, but a prior declaration may be required depending on your municipality. We advise you to check with your local administration. We can guide you through these steps."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do adjustable louvres work?",
          "answer": "The adjustable louvres can rotate from 0° to 135° thanks to an electric motor controlled by remote or smartphone. In the closed position, they protect against rain. When open, they let light and air through. A rain sensor can automatically close the louvres."

        {
          "question": "What is the lifespan of an aluminium pergola?",

          "question": "Do I need a permit to build a veranda in Belgium?",

          "question": "What is the difference between a veranda and a pergola?",
          "answer": "A veranda is a closed extension of the house, fully glazed and insulated, usable all year round as living space. A pergola is an open or semi-open structure, ideal for enjoying the outdoors with sun protection. Both can be combined."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I heat a veranda in winter?",
